# Galinha

```
Farmers
They collect eggs from the poor chicken
Enslave them
Force them to work without pay

A ghost from the past
Seeks revenge from the farmer

While a fearless chicken 
Tries to save his family
From the hands of the greedy farmer

Chicken and spirit 
Unite to free their own kind 
From the hands of an evil farmer

That lives in the top of a mountain.
```
